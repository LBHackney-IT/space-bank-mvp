# space-bank-mvp

MVP for the Space Bank project.

## Development
Clone this repo and run `npm install`. You'll need to have already installed `node`, `gulp` & `npm`. To start development server and build the page/s run `gulp dev`.

Server is just local and will autorefresh when a `pug` file is modified & saved. Everything is inlined, therefore for example changes to `css` files will trigger a browser refresh only on any view saving.

More to come....

# space-bank-mvp

MVP for the Space Bank project.

## Development
Clone this repo and run `npm install`. You'll need to have already installed `node`, `gulp` & `npm`. To start development server and build the page/s run `gulp dev`.

Server is just local and will autorefresh when a `pug` file is modified & saved. Everything is inlined, therefore for example changes to `css` files will trigger a browser refresh only on any view saving.

More to come...

##To do:
- Learn how everything works (explore and understand the code base)
- Learn how to add and improve to the prototype
- Implement Google Maps JavaScript API (Watch tutorial)
- Learn about PUG https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html
- Read into how APIs work (Read GDS APIs link - are GDS APIs relevant in anyway? - What about the Hackney APIs - Check API Hub: )
